How to push to github:
1. navigate to file
2. git add whatever you want to add (--all)
3. git commit -m "name it"
3.1 use git init to initialize a git repository in the folder
3.2 use git remote add origin (then url of the repository online)
3.3 git remote -v will show it working

4. git push origin (where? online repository) master (what branch? the main branch)

you may need to git pull origin master if your files arent synced.

cp copies stuff, put a location after to put it
/* selects all of it.
cd .. goes up a directory
~/ goes to home folder. This is in partition
mkdir ~/name of the directory youre trying to make
touch with name makes a folder
rm -rf is used to remove directories
